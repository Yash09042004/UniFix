## ✨ What is UniFix?

**UniFix** is a lightweight Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) designed to simplify technical maintenance and support inside campus laboratories. It automates:

- ⚙️ Dependency installation (Python, Java, Docker, compilers… you name it!)
- 🗃️ Database setup (MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB)
- 🛠️ System fixes (Common Linux configs, broken packages, permissions)
- 📦 Storage configuration (NFS mounts, Samba shares)
- 📋 Utility management (Network fixes, environment variables, and more)

💡 **Imagine this:** A student downloads a script from UniFix → Executes it → Problem solved in one shot.

## 🌍 Why UniFix?

- ✅ **Save hours of lab time** — No more googling "how to install XYZ".
- ✅ **Standardized fixes** — Same scripts work across multiple machines.
- ✅ **Open & Extensible** — Anyone can request or contribute new scripts/domains.
- ✅ **Friendly for all** — Whether you’re a fresher or a faculty, UniFix makes lab life easier.
